        I like small programs that do one thing and do it cleanly.
        Bug reports (which will happen as I cannot test every possible hardware configuration, sigh)
        can be posted on the website: sleepfuriously.com. Thanks for using my little app!
        \n\n
        Update: this is the 2nd version as Google took down my first (and perfectly working)
        version just because it was old. Lots of your favorite apps will follow the same
        demise as programmers can't be bothered to keep updating their apps just because
        big corporations don\'t care about the little guy. Feel free to make your displeasure
        known by commenting in your blog, social media, and to anyone who asks your for money.
